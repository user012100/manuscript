			<h3>Color juxtaposition — harmony — quantity</h3>
			<h4>Harmony</h4>
			<p>
				Color systems usually lead to the conclusion<br>
				that certain constellations within a system provide color harmony.<br>
				They indicate that this is mainly the aim and the end<br>
				of color combination, of color juxtaposition.<br>
				<br>
				As harmony and harmonizing is also a concern of music, so<br>
				a parallelism of effect between tone combinations and color combinations<br>
				seems unavoidable and appropriate. Although<br>
				a comparison of composed colors with composed tones is very challenging,<br>
				it should be mentioned that, while it can be helpful,<br>
				it is often misleading.<br>
				<br>
				This is because different basic conditions of these media result in<br>
				different behavior.<br>
				<br>
				Tones appear placed and directed predominantly in time from before<br>
				to now to later.<br>
				<br>
				Their juxtaposition in a musical composition is perceived<br>
				within a prescribed sequence only. Vertically, so to say,<br>
				1 tone, or several simultaneously,<br>
				sound for a varying but restricted length of time.<br>
				Horizontally, the tones follow each other,<br>
				perhaps not in a straight line, but of necessity in a prescribed order<br>
				and only in 1 direction — forward.<br>
				Tones heard earlier fade, and those farther back disappear, vanish.<br>
				We do not hear them backward.<br>
				<br>
				Colors appear connected predominantly in space. Therefore,<br>
				as constellations they ean be seen in any direction and<br>
				at any speed. And as they remain, we can return to them repeatedly<br>
				and in many ways.<br>
				<br>
				This remaining and not remaining, or vanishing and not vanishing,<br>
				shows only 1 essential difference between the fields of tone<br>
				and color.<br>
				<br>
				The accuracy of perception in one field is matched<br>
				by the durability of retention in the other, demonstrating<br>
				a curious reversal in visual and auditory memory.<br>
				<br>
				Tone juxtapositions can be defined by their acoustical relationship<br>
				and thus measured precisely by wave length.<br>
				<br>
				Consequently, a graphic registration of tones in musical composition<br>
				has been developed.<br>
				<br>
				Color, also, can be measured, at least to some extent,<br>
				and particularly so when it is presented as direct color —<br>
				as the physicist registers it, by optical wave length.<br>
				<br>
				Reflected color, however, coming from paint and pigment<br>
				— our main medium — is much more difficult to define.<br>
				<br>
				When analyzed with an electrical spectrograph<br>
				reflected color shows that it contains all visible wave lengths.<br>
				Therefore, any reflected color — not just white —<br>
				consists of other colors.<br>
				<br>
				This many-sided relationship between colors is clearly visible<br>
				in the plates of a 4-color reproduction, when singly shown,<br>
				because each of the 4 plates, although presenting only 1 color,<br>
				shows a complete picture.<br>
				<br>
				Color, when practically applied, not only appears in uncountable<br>
				shades and tints, but is additionally characterized<br>
				by shape and size, by recurrence and placement, and so on, of which<br>
				particularly shape and size are not directly applicable<br>
				to tones.<br>
				All this may signify why any color composition naturally defies<br>
				such diagrammatic registration as notation in music<br>
				and choreography in dance.<br>
				<br>
				With regard to constellation, tone intervals, such as third, fifth, and octave,<br>
				differentiate exact vertical distance. We say “vertical” probably because<br>
				tones are described as low and high.<br>
				Slide deflections (aberrations), such as in flat and sharp,<br>
				remain equally precise.<br>
				Color terms which could be considered parallel to tone intervals<br>
				are complementaries, split complementaries, triads, tetrads, and octads.<br>
				Though these characterize distance and constellation within color systems,<br>
				their deflections, such as incomplete triads and incomplete tetrads,<br>
				indicate that their measure is only arbitrary.<br>
				<br>
				Significantly, complementaries, though they are the basic color contrast<br>
				or interval, are topographically quite vague.<br>
				<br>
				In principle, a complementary is a color accompanied by its after-image.<br>
				<br>
				However, the complement of a specific color, when placed<br>
				in different systems, will look different.<br>
				<br>
