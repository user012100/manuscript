				<h3>Color juxtaposition — harmony — quantity</h3>
				<h4>Harmony</h4>
				<!-- the line breaks/ragging is from the original text, I checked 2 editions of the text and they both contained it, 
				to me it does read a little in a poetic prose so I wanted to preserve it -->
				<p>
					Color systems usually lead to the conclusion<br>
					that certain constellations within a system provide color harmony.<br>
					They indicate that this is mainly the aim and the end<br>
					of color combination, of color juxtaposition.<br>
					<br>
					As harmony and harmonizing is also a concern of music, so<br>
					a parallelism of effect between tone combinations and color combinations<br>
					seems unavoidable and appropriate. Although<br>
					a comparison of composed colors with composed tones is very challenging,<br>
					it should be mentioned that, while it can be helpful,<br>
					it is often misleading.<br>
					<br>
					This is because different basic conditions of these media result in<br>
					different behavior.<br>
					<br>
					Tones appear placed and directed predominantly in time from before<br>
					to now to later.<br>
					<br>
					Their juxtaposition in a musical composition is perceived<br>
					within a prescribed sequence only. Vertically, so to say,<br>
					1 tone, or several simultaneously,<br>
					sound for a varying but restricted length of time.<br>
					Horizontally, the tones follow each other,<br>
					perhaps not in a straight line, but of necessity in a prescribed order<br>
					and only in 1 direction — forward.<br>
					Tones heard earlier fade, and those farther back disappear, vanish.<br>
					We do not hear them backward.<br>
					<br>
					Colors appear connected predominantly in space. Therefore,<br>
					as constellations they ean be seen in any direction and<br>
					at any speed. And as they remain, we can return to them repeatedly<br>
					and in many ways.<br>
					<br>
					This remaining and not remaining, or vanishing and not vanishing,<br>
					shows only 1 essential difference between the fields of tone<br>
					and color.<br>
					<br>
					The accuracy of perception in one field is matched<br>
					by the durability of retention in the other, demonstrating<br>
					a curious reversal in visual and auditory memory.<br>
					<br>
					Tone juxtapositions can be defined by their acoustical relationship<br>
					and thus measured precisely by wave length.<br>
					<br>
					Consequently, a graphic registration of tones in musical composition<br>
					has been developed.<br>
					<br>
					Color, also, can be measured, at least to some extent,<br>
					and particularly so when it is presented as direct color —<br>
					as the physicist registers it, by optical wave length.<br>
					<br>
					Reflected color, however, coming from paint and pigment<br>
					— our main medium — is much more difficult to define.<br>
					<br>
					When analyzed with an electrical spectrograph<br>
					reflected color shows that it contains all visible wave lengths.<br>
					Therefore, any reflected color — not just white —<br>
					consists of other colors.<br>
					<br>
					This many-sided relationship between colors is clearly visible<br>
					in the plates of a 4-color reproduction, when singly shown,<br>
					because each of the 4 plates, although presenting only 1 color,<br>
					shows a complete picture.<br>
					<br>
					Color, when practically applied, not only appears in uncountable<br>
					shades and tints, but is additionally characterized<br>
					by shape and size, by recurrence and placement, and so on, of which<br>
					particularly shape and size are not directly applicable<br>
					to tones.<br>
					All this may signify why any color composition naturally defies<br>
					such diagrammatic registration as notation in music<br>
					and choreography in dance.<br>
					<br>
					With regard to constellation, tone intervals, such as third, fifth, and octave,<br>
					differentiate exact vertical distance. We say “vertical” probably because<br>
					tones are described as low and high.<br>
					Slide deflections (aberrations), such as in flat and sharp,<br>
					remain equally precise.<br>
					Color terms which could be considered parallel to tone intervals<br>
					are complementaries, split complementaries, triads, tetrads, and octads.<br>
					Though these characterize distance and constellation within color systems,<br>
					their deflections, such as incomplete triads and incomplete tetrads,<br>
					indicate that their measure is only arbitrary.<br>
					<br>
					Significantly, complementaries, though they are the basic color contrast<br>
					or interval, are topographically quite vague.<br>
					<br>
					In principle, a complementary is a color accompanied by its after-image.<br>
					<br>
					However, the complement of a specific color, when placed<br>
					in different systems, will look different.<br>
					<br>
					Similarly, a triad or tetrad of one system will hardly fit<br>
					into another system.<br>
					<br>
					Usually, illustrations of harmonic color constellations which derive<br>
					from authoritative systems look pleasant, beautiful, and thus convincing.<br>
					But it should not be overlooked that they are usually presented in a<br>
					most theoretical and least practicable manner, because normally<br>
					all harmony members appear in the same quantity and the same shape,<br>
					as well as in the same number (just once) and sometimes even in similar<br>
					light intensity.<br>
					Such outer equalization may unify them, but at the expense<br>
					of the more important inner relatedness — namely, as color only.<br>
					<br>
					When applied in practice, these harmony sects appear changed.<br>
					In addition to quantity, form, and recurrence,<br>
					wider aspects exert still more changing influences.<br>
					These are:<br>
					<!-- I want to remove the bullet points in the list thru css -->
					<ul>
						<li>
							Changed and changing light — and, even worse,<br>
							several simultaneous lights;
						</li>
						<li>reflection of lights and of colors;</li>
						<li>direction and sequence of reading;</li>
						<li>presentation in varying materials;</li>
						<li>
							constant or altering juxtaposition of related<br>
							and unrelated objects.
						</li>
					</ul>
					With these and other visual displacements, it should not be a surprise<br>
					that the sympathetic effect of the original “ideal” color combination<br>
					often appears changed, lost, and reversed.<br>
					<br>
					Observe the interior and exterior, the furniture and textile decoration<br>
					following such color schemes, as well as commercialized color “suggestions”<br>
					for innumerable do-it-yourselves.<br>
					<br>
					Our conclusion: we may forget for a while those rules of thumb<br>
					of complementaries, whether complete or “split,” and of triads and<br>
					tetrads as well.<br>
					They are worn out.<br>
					<br>
					Second, no mechanical color system is flexible enough<br>
					to precalculate the manifold changing factors, as named before,<br>
					in a single prescribed recipe.<br>
					<br>
					Good painting, good coloring, is comparable to good cooking.<br>
					Even a good cooking recipe demands tasting and repeated tasting<br>
					while it is being followed.<br>
					And the best tasting still depends on a cook with taste.<br>
					<br>
					By giving up preference for harmony,<br>
					we accept dissonance to be as desirable as consonance.<br>
					<br>
					In searching for new color organization — color design —<br>
					we have come to think that quantity, intensity, or weight, as principles of study,<br>
					can lead similarly to illusions, to new relationships, to different measurements,<br>
					to other systems, as do transparence, space, and intersection.<br>
					<br>
					Besides a balance through color harmony, which is comparable<br>
					to synmmetry, there is equilibrium possible between<br>
					color tensions, related to a more dynamic asymmetry.<br>
					<br>
					Again: knowledge and its application is not our aim:<br>
					instead, it is flexible imagination, discovery, invention — taste.<br>
					<br>
					With this study of color effects, that is, of color deception,<br>
					a special interest in quantity — amount as well as recurrence —<br>
					has developed.

				<h4>Quantity</h4>
				<p>
					Although quantity and quality often are considered disparate, in art and<br>
					music they appear closely related. We may even hear, “Quantity<br>
					is a quality,” because here quantity not only designates amounts,<br>
					as of weight or number, but also is a means of underlining,<br>
					of pronouncement, and a means of equilibrium, of balance.<br>
					<br>
					One who particularly recognized the latter was Schopenhauer.<br>
					When he tried to improve Goethe’s 6-part color circle — to Goethe's dismay —<br>
					he changed the previous presentation of 6 equal areas to decidedly<br>
					different quantities.<br>
					<br>
					Thus yellow, the lightest color, appears in the smaller amount,<br>
					and its opposite, violet, as the darkest, in the largest amount,<br>
					He first allotted 3 equal thirds of a color ring to the 3 pairs<br>
					of opposites — yellow & violet — blue & orange — red & green.<br>
					Second, he subdivided those thirds, for the same order of pairs,<br>
					in ¼ + ¾ − ⅓ + ⅔ − ½ + ½. These figures<br>
					in fractions of 12ths (relatively 36ths) are proportionate to<br>
					<!-- i'm not sure if these colons from the text 
					are supposed to be a division sign (÷)
					or if the author meant it as "such that" (:) -->
					3 : 9 − 4 : 8 − 6 : 6 equal parts.<br>
					When seen in a color circle, from yellow around to green, they present<br>
					the following quantities: 3 : 4 : 6 : 9 : 8 : 6.<br>
					<br>
					The 2 basic quantity questions, how much and how often,<br>
					distinguish 2 kinds of quantity:<br>
					1 of size — extension in area — and<br>
					1 of recurrence — extension in number.<br>
					Both measurements concern predominance and emphasis.<br>
					They establish weight in space — and weight in time.<br>
					<br>
					Such considerations are both the source and result of our quantity studies<br>
					in which 4 colors usually appear in 4 different juxtapositions,<br>
					so different that all 4 studies appear as unrelated as possible.<br>
					<br>
					And thus they present changes in climate or temperature,<br>
					in tempo or rhythm — that is, changes of atmosphere or mood,<br>
					so that the factual contents (the same 4 colors) are hidden or, better,<br>
					hardly recognizable.<br>
					<br>
					To use a theatrical parallel:<br>
					A set of 4 colors is to be considered — singly as “actors,”<br>
					together as “cast.” They are to be presented in 4 different<br>
					arrangements — as “performances.”<br>
					<br>
					Although they remain unchanged in hue and light, in “character,”<br>
					and appear in an unchanging outer frame, the “stage,”<br>
					they are to produce 4 different “scenes” or “plays,”<br>
					cach to be so different that one and the same set of colors will be seen as<br>
					4 different sets, presented by 4 different casts.<br>
					<br>
					And all this can be achieved mainly through changes in quantity<br>
					which result in shifts of dominance, of recurrence, and consequently<br>
					of placement.<br>
					<br>
					The essential question: which group of colors is ready to lose<br>
					its identity as a cast?<br>
					<br>
					A parallel question: which distribution of appearance<br>
					(quantities of space, tine, and weight) protects, disguises<br>
					recognition of the same color cast?<br>
					<br>
					Such quantity studies have taught us to believe that, independent<br>
					of harmony rules, any color “goes” or “works” with any other color,<br>
					presupposing that their quantities are appropriate.<br>
					We feel fortunate that so far there are no comprehensive rules<br>
					for such aims.<br>
					<br>
					Here we may point to a discovery made by a few contemporary painters,<br>
					that the increase in amount of a color — not merely in size of canvas —<br>
					visually reduces distance. As a consequence, it often produces nearness —<br>
					meaning intimacy — and respect.
