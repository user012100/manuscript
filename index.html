			<h3>Color juxtaposition — harmony — quantity</h3>
			<h4>Harmony</h4>
			<p>
				Color systems usually lead to the conclusion<br>
				that certain constellations within a system provide color harmony.<br>
				They indicate that this is mainly the aim and the end<br>
				of color combination, of color juxtaposition.<br>
				<br>
				As harmony and harmonizing is also a concern of music, so<br>
				a parallelism of effect between tone combinations and color combinations<br>
				seems unavoidable and appropriate. Although<br>
				a comparison of composed colors with composed tones is very challenging,<br>
				it should be mentioned that, while it can be helpful,<br>
				it is often misleading.<br>
				<br>
				This is because different basic conditions of these media result in<br>
				different behavior.<br>
				<br>
				Tones appear placed and directed predominantly in time from before<br>
				to now to later.<br>
				<br>
				Their juxtaposition in a musical composition is perceived<br>
				within a prescribed sequence only. Vertically, so to say,<br>
				1 tone, or several simultaneously,<br>
				sound for a varying but restricted length of time.<br>
				Horizontally, the tones follow each other,<br>
				perhaps not in a straight line, but of necessity in a prescribed order<br>
				and only in 1 direction – forward.<br>
				Tones heard earlier fade, and those farther back disappear, vanish.<br>
				We do not hear them backward.<br>
				<br>
				Colors appear connected predominantly in space. Therefore,<br>
				as constellations they ean be seen in any direction and<br>
				at any speed. And as they remain, we can return to them repeatedly<br>
				and in many ways.<br>
				<br>
				This remaining and not remaining, or vanishing and not vanishing,<br>
				shows only 1 essential difference between the fields of tone<br>
